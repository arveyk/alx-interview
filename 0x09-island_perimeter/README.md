<h3><-- Island Perimeter- ALX interview prep --></h3>

In this interview preparation challange, we are to evaluate the perimeter of an island represented by a 2D grid.
Concepts being tested
	- 2D array matrices
	- Conditional Logic, to determine which cell constributes to the
	perimeter of the wall
	-Counting techniques for counting the edges that constribute the islands	perimeter
	- Problem-solving strategies
	- Python programming
